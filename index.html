    	<h1>Welcome. Here you can learn/teach and share awesome Graffiti!</h1>
    	<p>Drawing is a great and inexpensive way to pass time. One type of drawing that I enjoy is lettering or graffiti. Here's why I like it:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It's <strong>fun!!!</strong></li>
        <li>Inexpensive!</li>
        <li>And it gives an opportunity to be <em>creative</em> and solve design challenges!</li>
      </ul>

    			<td>Paper</td>
    			<td>Markers have a tendency to bleed through paper and ruin the paper you are working on. For best results I like some heavy duty sketchbook paper.</td>
    			<td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_3_6?url=search-alias%3Darts-crafts&field-keywords=sketchbook&sprefix=Sketch%2Cgarden%2C157">Amazon</a> is a great place to browse/buy.</td>
    		</tr>
    		<tr>
    			<td>Pencil and eraser</td>
    			<td>I first light sketch with pencil to get some idea of placement size volume and style. Any pencil will do, I prefer 2H pencil.</td>
    			<td>Pick up at your local art/office supply store or look online.</td>

    			<td>Markers</td>
    			<td>Experiment with different markers and find the ones you like most, my favorite are utrecht design markers.</td>

      <h3><a href="http://klughaus.net/">This</a> is an example of the website I'd like to make.</h3>
      <p>Some of the tags I didn't recognize were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>link tag - this links css and possibly other resources to style/modify webpage</li>
        <li>script tag - connects a script to your website(not sure if only javascript or some others too)</li>
        <li>meta tag - adds additional info to the page, makes search engine's job easier </li>
      </ul>
      <p>It looks like a great website. It has a great design, content is easy to read/access. It is responsive and functions well. Styling as well as deeper understanding of programming make it better then my website, I hope to learn more css and javascript libraries in future to be able to make a website like this.</p>
