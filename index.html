            <h1>Welcome!!! <span class="orange">Learn/teach</span> and <span class="orange">share</span> awesome Graffiti!</h1>
            <p>Drawing is a great and inexpensive way to pass time. One type of drawing that I enjoy is lettering or graffiti. Here's why I like it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It's <strong class="orange">fun!!!</strong></li>
                <li>Inexpensive!</li>
                <li>And it gives an opportunity to be <em class="orange">creative</em> and solve design challenges!</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><a href="http://klughaus.net/">klughaus.net</a> is an example of the website I'd like to make.</h3>
            <p>Some of the tags I didn't recognize were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>link tag</em> - this links css and possibly other resources to style/modify webpage</li>
                <li><em>script tag</em> - connects a script to your website(not sure if only javascript or some others too)</li>
                <li><em>meta tag</em> - adds additional info to the page, makes search engine's job easier </li>
            </ul>
            <p>It looks like a great website. It has a great design, content is easy to read/access. It is responsive and functions well. Styling as well as deeper understanding of programming make it better then my website, I hope to learn more css and javascript libraries in future to be able to make a website like this.</p>
